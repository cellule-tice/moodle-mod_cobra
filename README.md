## General information ##

CoBRA (aka COrpus-Based Reading Assistant) help French speaking students to read texts in English and Dutch. 

Students can click on any word or expression in a CoBRA text to get disambiguated information about it (syntactical category, gender, inflected forms, translation in the reading context) as well as usage examples in the same context as the reading one. 

Every clicked word or expression can be added to an exportable personal glossary.
