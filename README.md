## General information ##

CoBRA (aka COrpus-Based Reading Assistant) help French speaking students to read texts in English and Dutch. 

Students can click on any word or expression in a CoBRA text to get disambiguated information about it (syntactical category, gender, inflected forms, translation in the reading context) as well as usage examples in similar contexts. 

Every clicked word or expression can be added to an exportable personal glossary.

Available CoBRA-formatted texts are hosted on a dedicated server and are loaded through an api.

## Access ##
A demo access to CoBRA-formatted texts with an English and a Dutch text is available for testing purposes. (See Installation section for instructions on how you can get a demo key)
Note that the full CoBRA text repository is not in open access, some resources (dictionaries, texts) being subject to copyright.
